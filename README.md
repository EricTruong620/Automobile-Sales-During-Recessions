# Automobile-Sales-During-Recessions

**Project Description:**

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook for visualizations which needed to be imported from the web and a Python file for creating a dashboard. The visualizations and dashboard are based on a dataset of automobile sales during a recession.

**How to Install and Run the Project:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook application.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook file.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
5. Run the code in the Jupyter Notebook to import the visualizations from the web.
6. Open the Python file in an IDE.
7. Run these 3 commands in your IDE's terminal
  a. pip3.8 install setuptools
  b. python3.8 -m pip install packaging
  c. python3.8 -m pip install pandas dash
8.Run the python program on your IDE's Terminal using this command:
  a. python3.8 IBM_8_Part_2.py
9.Use the port number (4 digit code after the collin in the ip address) in the terminal on the Launch Application option of your IDE to run the dashboard

**How to Use the Project:**

The Jupyter Notebook contains visualizations of the automobile sales data. The visualizations can be used to explore the data and identify trends. The dashboard provides a more interactive way to explore the data. The dashboard allows users to filter the data by various criteria and to see different visualizations of the data.

**Introduction:**

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook for visualizations which needed to be imported from the web and a Python file for creating a dashboard. The visualizations and dashboard are based on a dataset of automobile sales during a recession.

**Visualizations:**

The Jupyter Notebook contains the following visualizations of the automobile sales data:

* Line charts showing the total number of automobile sales over time.
* Bar charts showing the number of automobile sales during recessions and non-recession periods.
* A line chart showing GPD variation during recession and non recession periods.
* A bubble chart showing the impact of seasonality on automobile sales.
* Scatterplots showing the correlation between sales, consumer confidence and Vehicle Prices
* A pie chart displaying advertisment expenditure during recession and non recession periods
* A pie chart displaying share of vehicle sales during recessions
* A count plot showing the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle ypes and sales during a recession

**Dashboard:**

The Python file creates a dashboard that allows users to filter the automobile sales data by various criteria and to see different visualizations of the data. The dashboard includes the following features:

* A drop-down menu that allows users to select Statstics by year and Recession period.
* For recession Periods:
  * A line chart showing the total number of automobile sales over time.
  * A bar chart showing the average number of vehicles sold by vehicle type.
  * A pie chart showing the percentage of automobile sales by vehicle type.
  * A bar chart showing the effect of unemployment rate of vehicle type and sales.
* For Yearly Statistics:
  * A line chart showing the total number of automobile sales for that year.
  * A line chart showing the total monthly sales of each type of automobile for that year.
  * A bar chart showing the average number of vehicles sold for that year.
  * A pie chart showing the advertisement expediture for each vehicle for that year. 

**Conclusion:**

This project provides a way to visualize and explore automobile sales data during a recession. The Jupyter Notebook contains visualizations of the data, and the Python file creates a dashboard that allows users to filter the data and see different visualizations of the data.
